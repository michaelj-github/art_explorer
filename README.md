   - Art lovers, people who would probably visit the art museum if the can but may want to see images of the art online.
3. What data do you plan on using? You may have not picked your actual API yet, which is fine, just outline what kind of data you would like it to contain.
   - Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection API
